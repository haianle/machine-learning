## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r}
getSymbol <- function(number) {
# Function that takes a number (0,1,2) and returns the associated rock/paper/scissor
# Note you don't need to use this function if you are happy to just use the number representation
  if (number == 0) {
    return("rock")
  } else if (number == 1) {
    return("paper") 
  } else if (number == 2) {
    return("scissors")
  } else {
    stop("Invalid Play!!")
  }
}
